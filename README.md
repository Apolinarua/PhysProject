# PhysProject
physproj1a shows projectile motion if you're given only v0 and angle
physproj1b shows projectile motion if you're given goal coordinates
physproj2a shows projectile motion with air resistance if you're given v0 and angle
physproj2b shows projectile motion with air resistance if you're given goal coordinates :)
